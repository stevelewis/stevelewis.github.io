          <h3>About</h3>
          <p>Since March of 2014, I've been working with Chartio building a data analytics tool for companies. Data visualizations are rad.</p>
          <p>Before this, I worked with a small started up called Designly, which began in Pittsburgh, PA. Our team came to San Francisco in 2012 to participate in the Launch Hackathon, and ended up winning first place with a tool called WizzyWig. We were later accepted into Y Combinator, at which point we all moved West to California.</p>
          <p>In college I studied graphic design and printmaking, learned how to build websites and made a comic book. Right after college, I worked for a few sign shops and even a pennysaver.</p>
          <p>Before college, and before I had ever heard the phrase "graphic design", I made t-shirts, stickers, pins, patches and best of all, CD covers, for my friends' bands. I like music a lot, and still like to <a href="http://notsteve.com/2016-covers/" target="_blank">make covers for fun</a> (and am working on new ones for 2017).</p>
          <p>I believe Massimo Vignelli when he said, "If you can design one thing, you can design everything." </p>
          <p>I also really like board games.</p>
