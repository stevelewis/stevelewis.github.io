          <h2>The Chartio Application</h2>
          <p>I love charts. I’m a big fan of visualizing data because sometimes raw numbers just don’t communicate enough. I realize I’m a visual person by nature, but I believe we can all benefit from being able to see some numbers, especially when spread out over a dimension like time.</p>
          <p>When I came on, Chartio had a chart creation interface which was the core of their product. Charts generated here could be saved to dashboards, and these dashboards all lived in a dropdown menu in the navbar. There were also links for the settings page and support pages.</p>
          <p><em>The challenge was to expand the application from here, while mainting what current customers where building and able to do.</em></p>

          <p>There were little things I wanted to fix. Like how changing the data source dropdown within a layer changed the list of tables available to drag in, from outside the layer.</p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-sm-8 offset-sm-2">
          <p>The team was looking to make bigger changes though, and rightly so. Early customers loved how easy it was to make charts, but they quickly were trying to bulid more and more complex queries. Unfortunately the interface was hitting it’s limitations. For example, data could be blended together from different sources, but the “merge” was forced to happen at a very specific and early point in the process. Many people wanted to edit the data a bit and then merge things together. </p>
          <p>There were also a lot of common actions the team felt we could somehow help customers do, like grouping and extrapolating data, but there was nowhere in the interface for “snippets” or canned actions. A customer could manipulate the underlying data table in the the “Formulas” section, but changes were permanent and limited to basic actions that had clear effects, like adding a new column based on existing ones.</p>
          <p>Another problem with this section was when someone would come back to a chart weeks or months later, and usually couldn’t remember all the fancy data maneuvers they had done. Or worse, someone else on the team would want to see how a chart was built, perhaps trying to learn how to make their own charts, but it was difficult to impossible to determine how the original creator had arrived at the underlying data table.</p>
          <p>Essentially, people wanted the “steps” used to build a chart to be visible, hopefully editable. Enter, the “Data Pipeline”.</p>

          <p>The introduction of the Data Pipeline was a pretty big change to the interface. Some would call it a “redesign”. We put the querying section (with that dropdown moved) to the left and the final resulting chart to the right. For a lot of simple charts which don’t need transformations, this is all you need. The right half is fixed so the final result is always visible. The left half scrolls to show the actual Pipeline intself. This replaces the “Formulas” section and allows for steps to be added and removed independently of one another. These “steps” do simple things like add a column or hide a column, but also allow for the fancier things the Chartio team had been dreaming up.</p>

          <p>In this interface, the merging of data is just another step, so transformations to the data could be made before and after data gets blended together. There’s also some less noticable, but still very powerful interface changes, like the addition of the “OR” filter button.</p>
          <p>By default the “Filters” zone uses AND logic, so data must match all the conditions to be returned. Once at least one field has been added, the user can click a new “OR” button to create a new dropzone, which will use OR logic in relation to the other zones. “OR” buttons will continue being added as long as one keeps adding a filter to each dropzone.</p>

          <p>Another great feature we were able to add is the Input & Output displays. This expands a preview of the data going into and out of each step in the Pipeline. This helps new people learning what things like “pivoting” data really do, as they can see the the data before and after every change.</p>

          <p>In fact, I looked for all kinds of places to add helpful information. Another example is when a user picks a chart type that can’t be built with the current data table they’re outputting. Instead of displaying an error, we now show a description and little example of what you need to make your data table look like and why.</p>

          <h2>Improving Dashboard Arrangement</h2>
          <p>On the other side of the product were the dashboards which the charts eventually were saved to. Some early user-testing sessions with Chartio revealed an issue a lot of new people trying out the app hit: They didn’t know how to edit the dashboard. There was a button labeled “Arrange Mode” among a few others, like “Add a Chart”. Once the button was toggled, all the charts had handles and could be moved around and resized. The charts were even responsive and would adapt to just about any size box you made for them. The issue was if you missed the button, well you were out of luck.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, people wanted and expected to be able to edit charts without toggling into “Arrange Mode”. I partnered with a developer to create prototypes (in Codepen) where I honed in on what it took to communicate “you can grab me anywhere in these blocks”, “grab and drag from this corner to resize me” and “click here for a big ‘ol menu of options for this chart” at the appropriate times.</p>

          <h2>Finding Dashboards</h2>
          <p>One other change to the Chartio product I made which had a big impact was the addition of an in-app homepage. Before, the only way to get to different dashboards was through a dropdown menu in the top navigation bar. Customers were often surprised the logo took them to the main settings page.</p>
          <p>Another thing we noticed was customers would sometimes forget what a dashboard was called, or maybe they didn't know the exact name in the first place (imagine your boss says "check the marketing dashboard" rather than the exact title). We wanted to add ways to discover popular dashboards. An obvious answer seemed to be adding some kind of thumbnail preview for dashboards, but this was actually much harder to pull off than I had expected. Many customers were very sensative to the idea of images of their data being saved somewhere, and generating dashboards full of charts on the spot was more or less impossible.</p>
          <p>First, we tried introducing this as a way to keep a history of your dashboards. Even then, we had to settle for making the feature opt-in. To make up for the lack of real chart previews from some customers, we developed simple dummy charts for each chart type as standins in the thumbnails.</p>

            <figcaption>The new in-app home page is a great improvement over the previous nav dropdown list. Customers can filter by category, see who's viewed or edited dashboars recently, and get thumbnail previews.</figcaption>

          <p>Recently, I’ve been working with the team to improve a customers first-time experience even more. We’re experimenting with ways to offer people the right advice at the right time when getting started, like a guided tour of the chart creation interface.</p>
