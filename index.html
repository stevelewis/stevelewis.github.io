I developed this site to better appreciate the detail in each font and character, and to better enable a side-by-side comparison of the individual letters and complete paragraphs. Every typeface is unique, and “Font Flipper” enables the user to view multiple fonts, compare, and choose the best fit for their products, whether it is a book title, a page header, or just for fun. Type is a complicated, and beautiful thing. </p><a href="http://notsteve.com/font-flipper" target="_blank" title="The Font Flipper">notsteve.com/font-flipper</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://www.laurastevenson.net/home" target="_blank" title="laura stevenson website"><img src="img/laura-shirt.png" alt="laura stevenson and the cans shirt"><img src="img/laura-sketches.png" alt="early sketches of Laura Stevenson shirt"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Laura Stevenson & the Cans </h3><p>This one started out as fan art. Making self-initated designs for bands I like is just one tactic I use to keep my skills sharp. If I can, I like to send what I've made to the band members. <em>Laura Stevenson and the Cans </em>are a spectacular indie/folk/rock band who eventually had their logo made into a T-shirt. After the first batch of shirts were printed and sold out, I receive an email informing me it was the most popular shirt they had. They reprinted the shirt, this time with different colors, and I finally got my hands on one. Like I said, the first batch sold out.</p><a href="http://www.laurastevenson.net/home" target="_blank" title="laura stevenson website">laurastevenson.net</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://onesecond.designly.com" target="_blank" title="One second on the internet"><img src="img/one-second.png" alt="One second on the internet page"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>One Second on the Internet</h3><p>One second doesn’t seem like much time, but a lot can happen. In one second, there are approximately 200 posts on Reddit, 4,000 tweets on Twitter, and 50,000 likes on Facebook. Visualizing the traffic the Internet experiences is very difficult. Once the numbers get so big, they start to lose meaning to us. This is why “One Second on the Internet” provides an illustration of how much activity takes place in such a small unit of time. </p><a href="http://onesecond.designly.com" target="_blank" title="One second on the internet">onesecond.designly.com</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://nickmalburg.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" title="Nick Malburg bandcamp page"><img src="img/nick-cover.png" alt="album cover for nick malburg"><img src="img/nick-cover-back.png" alt="album cover for nick malburg"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Nick Malburg: Word Murder</h3><p>Nick Malburg is solo folk/punk musician from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He not only writes catchy tunes, but amazing lyrics. The entire album, “Word Murder" was recorded and mixed by Nick himself. As an artist, he wanted the album cover to embody the DIY style. As such, I combined a handwritten font for the title, text from “Everything Matters” by Ron Curie JR., and a shot of the neck of his guitar. For Nick, the album was about balancing his thoughts and words with music, and I believe the cover equates that message. </p><a href="http://nickmalburg.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank" title="Nick Malburg bandcamp page">nickmalburg.bandcamp.com</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://notsteve.com/comic-shelf" target="_blank" title="On the Shelf"><img src="img/comic-shelf.png" alt="On the Shelf page"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>On the Shelf</h3><p>Comics are one of the reasons I do what I do. They fueled my interest in art as a kid, and I even made a comic book as one of my senior projects in college. I built this site to allow fans to virtually browse through new comic releases, and hopefully discover some new books to check out. There were several sites already with this information, but none of them really focused on the artwork or covers, which for me just would not do.</p><a href="http://notsteve.com/comic-shelf" target="_blank" title="On the Shelf">notsteve.com/comic-shelf</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://designly.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank"><img src="img/designly.png" alt="Designly.com page"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Designly</h3><p>I was originally hired to make logos, but was quickly propelled into much more active roles. I completely designed and coded the Designly site (twice) and helped with the design of several user interfaces. In addition, I created half of the themes provided and a series of coupon cards to be handed out at events. Designly underwent many changes in design, structure, goals, etc. I ended up writing blog posts, email campaigns, and several test pages and prototypes. In its entirety, it was a wholeheartedly rewarding experience and probably taught me more than any other job I've had.</p><a href="http://designly.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">designly.herokuapp.com</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><img src="img/dark-knight.png" alt="dark knight t-shirt"></div><div class="item-description"><h3>The Dark Knight Rises T-Shirt</h3><p>Batman. He has been my favorite super hero since I was 3 years old. I was even an extra in the newest flick, <em>The Dark Knight Rises. </em>When I heard about a T-Shirt contest judged by Christopher Nolan, the director, I knew I had to enter. I am exceptionally proud of this design, even if it was rejected for entry. The site holding the contest refused to believe I had received permission to use the typeface directly from it's creator. So it goes.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><img src="img/chimera.png" alt="chimera book"><img src="img/how-mag.png" alt="chimera award"></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Chimera Eight</h3><p>Chimera is an award-winning undergraduate Journal of Art and Literature from Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. As part of a seven-person design team, I helped to craft the eighth volume of Chimera. The book had a subtle prism theme, reflecting the variety of mediums and subject matter it contained. It was also the first year to include a DVD, which I designed the menu music for. It was an extraordinary learning experience. Contacting the printers, assessing costs, and choosing the paper stock were more complicated than we anticipated, but we persevered. We won multiple awards for the book, inlcuding one from <em>HOW Magazine. </em>My favorite part though is the white blocks on the cover which glow in the dark!</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><img src="img/searching.png" alt="soul searching print"><img src="img/dubduck.png" alt="soul searching print"></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Screen Prints</h3><p>Computers are excellent tools, but I find it refreshing to get my hands dirty. In college I was introduced to printmaking and it was a great reprieve from digital design. I love the experience of rolling ink, exposing screens, and seeing the satisfying, crisp print produced in the end (usually). I took enough classes, unbeknownst to me at the time, to earn a minor in printmaking. </p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://erieartmuseum.org/" target="_blank"><img src="img/handout.png" alt="handout for spring show"><img src="img/invite.png" alt="invitation for spring show"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Erie Art Museum Spring Show</h3><p>For the Erie Art Museum's 88th Annual Spring Show I wanted to get away from the obvious crocuses and daffodils. Instead, I strove to illustrate the essence of Spring in form on the page. The blocks of light, weightless text lean from side to side giving the subtle feeling of wind, while the light paper texture and bold yellow headlines warm your eyes. The pages mimic a leisurely stroll along Lake Erie’s shore.</p><a href="http://erieartmuseum.org/" target="_blank">erieartmuseum.org</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><a href="http://www.bombthemusicindustry.com/final.html" target="_blank"><img src="img/bomb-book.png" alt="Bomb the music industry lyric book"><img src="img/bomb-inside.png" alt="Inside spread of BTMI book"></a></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Bomb the Music Industry Book</h3><p>Jeff Rosenstock was the singer of punk-rock band, <em>Bomb the Music Industry. </em>Jeff's lyrics often get distorted by the fast-paced music and his intense, emotion-filled delivery. I crafted this “listener friendly” book to equip listeners with an easy-to-navigate guide to the lyrics flying by their ears. The book is color-coded by album, and page numbers correspond to the song's track number. The intensity of the page's color is linked to the tempo of each song. Duct tape binds the spine in true “punk” fashion.</p><a href="http://www.bombthemusicindustry.com/final.html" target="_blank">bombthemusicindustry.com</a></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><img src="img/quoem-cover.png" alt="quoem book"><img src="img/quoem-progress.png" alt="quoem book progression"></div><div class="item-description"><h3>New/Idea/Fresh/Poems</h3><p>Haiku is fascinating. Working within strict and rigid limitations is a challenge and inspires poetic compositions that would not otherwise exist. In admiration of the Haiku, I developed the “quoem.” Each quoem is four words long. No more, no less, in order to compliment the form of the Haiku. This hand bound book of quoems I produced is a  collection of work written by friends and myself. Each quoem is written over full-bleed photographs, which accent the words.</p></div></div><div class="item"><div class="item-image"><img src="img/gallery-full.png" alt="yeah, wer're designers but... show"><img src="img/gallery-chair.png" alt="a visitor in the gallery"></div><div class="item-description"><h3>Yeah, We're Designers, But...</h3><p>Creating a split-gallery show with JP Spanbauer, one of my best friends, was a life-altering experience. Although we are both graphic designers, we each have our own span of different and exciting interests. The gallery show highlighted both our design work and our side projects. My half of the gallery featured a collage of photographs nailed to the walls with cotton clouds and pieces of “sky,” which were suspended above the images. A recliner sitting next to a CD player featuring music I composed enabled the viewer to enter a world completely of my own creation. In addition to my own work, JP painted giant murals on his walls between his framed screen prints. His handmade, screen printed pillows rested on a large heater in the room most shows struggle to hide. Our design work was the centerpiece of the room, and was featured on podiums.</p></div></div><div class="footer">   <a href="mailto:steven@notsteve.com" title="Steven's email" class="responsive_links">steven@notsteve.com</a><a href="https://twitter.com/airguitarbandit" target="_blank" title="Steven's twitter page" class="responsive_links">@airguitarbandit</a></div></div></body></html>
