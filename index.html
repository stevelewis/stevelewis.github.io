          <h3>Chartio</h3>
          <p>For the past three years or so, I've been helping the Chartio team build an analytics tool anyone in a company can use. We've created a drag-and-drop interface to build complicated SQL queries which generates charts. These charts can then be saved to highly customizable and interactive dashboards.</p>
          <p>When I first started, I was the only designer at the company, but I've since helped bring on more design talent. It's been an exciting challenge building something with so many different use cases and moving parts. On the marketing side, I created Chartio's first brand guide and current website. I've also designed giveaway materials, BART ads, t-shirts, and more. And I get to make a lot of dashboards and charts, which I love. It's been an action-packed, lesson-filled journey so far and I can't wait to see where we go next.</p>

          <h3>Tax March San Francisco</h3>
          <p>In 2017, I found myself with a strong desire to do more work with people trying to make a positive impact on our world. So far, I’ve worked with two groups this year to create shirt designs for fundraising and spreading awareness. The first was the San Francisco Tax March, which took place on April 15, 2017. From Anne Pruett, director of the SF Tax March:</p>
          <p><em>His designs allowed us to raise thousands of dollars in fundraisers, spread the word with posters and pamphlets, and recruit new volunteers with recruitment campaigns both in print and online.</em></p>

          <h3>Friends of the San Juans</h3>
          <p>The second group I worked with this year was the Friends of the San Juans. They are an environmental protection group from the San Juans islands in Washington state. This group of lawyers works very hard to protect the beaches where they live, and they asked me to create a type-focused shirt based on this phrase describing the Orca whale food chain. Many of the locals love whale watching and the islands are famous for Orcas. They wanted the shirt to explain how the ecosystem is linked together in ways which may not be obvious to everyone, and hopefully show people why they worry so much about beach laws.</p>

          <h3>One Second on the Internet</h3>
          <p>One second doesn’t seem like much time, but a lot can happen. This page was originaly published as an inbound marketing piece in August of 2013. At the time there were, on average, around 200 posts on Reddit, 4,000 tweets on Twitter, and 50,000 likes on Facebook each and every second. Visualizing traffic like this can be difficult. Once the numbers get so big, they start to lose meaning to us. This is why “One Second on the Internet” provided an illustration of how much activity took place in such a small unit of time. Since I no longer control the page it hasn't been updated, and I frequently get emails pointing this out. For me it's now reminder of how quickly into the future we are sprinting.</p>

          <h3>Designly</h3>
          <p>I was originally hired to make logos. In a few short years, Designly took me from making graphics in Pennsylvania to participating in a Y Combinator startup in Silicon Valley. We expanded from making logos, to Bootstrap themes, to a WYSIWYG website editor, to a full-on site builder. I designed and developed the front-end of the Designly website (twice) and worked with the team to build several product interfaces. I also helped create blog posts, campaigns, prototypes, themes and more.</p>

          <h3>Laura Stevenson</h3>
          <p>This one started out as fan art. Making self-initated designs for bands I like is just one tactic I use to keep my skills sharp. If I can, I like to send what I've made to the band members. <em>Laura Stevenson and the Cans</em> are a spectacular indie/folk/rock band who eventually had their design made into a T-shirt. After the first batch of shirts were printed and sold out, I receive an email informing me it it had sold out rather fast. They reprinted the shirt, this time with different colors, and I finally got my hands on one. Like I said, the first batch sold out.</p>

          <h3>Erie Art Museum Spring Show</h3>
          <p>For the Erie Art Museum's 88th Annual Spring Show I wanted to get away from the obvious crocuses and daffodils. Instead, I strove to illustrate the essence of Spring in form on the page. The blocks of light, weightless text lean from side to side giving the subtle feeling of wind, while the light paper texture and bold yellow headlines warm your eyes. The pages mimic a leisurely stroll along Lake Erie’s shore.</p>

          <h3>Chimera Eight</h3>
          <p>Chimera is an award-winning undergraduate Journal of Art and Literature from Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. As part of a seven-person design team, I helped to craft the eighth volume of Chimera. The book had a subtle prism theme, reflecting the variety of mediums and subject matter it contained. It was also the first year to include a DVD, which I designed the menu music for. It was an extraordinary learning experience. Contacting the printers, assessing costs, and choosing the paper stock were more complicated than we anticipated, but we persevered. We won multiple awards for the book, inlcuding one from <em>HOW Magazine.</em> My favorite part though is the white blocks on the cover which glow in the dark!</p>

          <h3>Yeah, We're Designers, But...</h3>
          <p>Creating a split-gallery show with JP Spanbauer, one of my best friends, was a life-altering experience. Although we are both graphic designers, we each have our own span of different and exciting interests. The gallery show highlighted both our design work and our side projects. My half of the gallery featured a collage of photographs nailed to the walls bellow cotton clouds and pieces of “sky.” A recliner sitting next to a CD player featuring music I composed enabled the viewer to enter a world completely of my own creation. On the other side of the room, JP painted giant murals directly on the walls between framed screen prints. His handmade, screen printed pillows rested on a large heater in the room which most shows struggle to hide. Last, but not least, our design work was the centerpiece of the room, featured on podiums.</p>
