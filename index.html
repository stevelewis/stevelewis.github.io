          <h3>Chartio</h3>
          <p>I love charts. I've been working with Chartio for over 3 years now and have been lucky enough to work on a variety of exciting projects. I've played a key role in the company branding, the design of the product itself, as well as most of the development work for the marketing site. I've designed giveaway materials, t-shirts, BART ads, emails, prototypes, presentations and more. I also get to make a lot of dashboards and charts, which I love. I even composed some music for our first batch of promo videos. It's been an action-packed, lesson-filled journey so far and I can't wait to see where we go next. Did I mention I love charts?</p>

          <h3>Laura Stevenson T-shirt</h3>
          <p>This one started out as fan art. Making self-initated designs for bands I like is just one tactic I use to keep my skills sharp. If I can, I like to send what I've made to the band members. <em>Laura Stevenson and the Cans</em> are a spectacular indie/folk/rock band who eventually had their logo made into a T-shirt. After the first batch of shirts were printed and sold out, I receive an email informing me it was one of the most popular shirt they had. They reprinted the shirt, this time with different colors, and I finally got my hands on one. Like I said, the first batch sold out.</p>

          <h3>One Second on the Internet</h3>
          <p>One second doesn’t seem like much time, but a lot can happen. This page was originaly published as an inbound marketing piece in August of 2013. At that time there were on average around 200 posts on Reddit, 4,000 tweets on Twitter, and 50,000 likes on Facebook each and every second. Visualizing traffic like that can be difficult. Once the numbers get so big, they start to lose meaning to us. This is why “One Second on the Internet” provided an illustration of how much activity took place in such a small unit of time. Since I no longer control the page it hasn't been updated, and I frequently get emails pointing this out. For me it's now reminder of how quickly into the future we are sprinting.</p>

          <h3>Designly</h3>
          <p>I was originally hired to make logos, but was quickly propelled into much more active roles. I completely designed and coded the Designly site (twice) and helped with the design of several user interfaces. In addition, I created half of the themes provided and a series of coupon cards to be handed out at events. Designly underwent many changes in design, structure, goals, etc. I ended up writing blog posts, email campaigns, and several test pages and prototypes. In its entirety, it was a wholeheartedly rewarding experience.</p>

          <h3>Nick Malburg: Word Murder</h3>
          <p>Nick Malburg is solo folk/punk musician from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He not only writes catchy tunes, but amazing lyrics. The entire album, “Word Murder" was recorded and mixed by Nick himself. I combined a handwritten font for the title, text from “Everything Matters” by Ron Curie JR. (Nick's selection), and a shot of the neck of his guitar. For Nick, the album was about balancing his thoughts and words with music, and I believe the cover expresses that message.</p>

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p>My father is a photographer. He used to set up a studio’s-worth of equipment in our living room to take my baby pictures. Both my parents documented family vacations, but my dad always knew where to stand to catch the light just right. Knowing my way around a camera has come in handy for me time and time again, both in my work and personal life. Knowing how to make a piece of work look good, or create original background images for a website has been especially handy. Being able to capture little moments with my friends and family is even better.</p>

          <h3>Chimera Eight</h3>
          <p>Chimera is an award-winning undergraduate Journal of Art and Literature from Edinboro University in Pennsylvania. As part of a seven-person design team, I helped to craft the eighth volume of Chimera. The book had a subtle prism theme, reflecting the variety of mediums and subject matter it contained. It was also the first year to include a DVD, which I designed the menu music for. It was an extraordinary learning experience. Contacting the printers, assessing costs, and choosing the paper stock were more complicated than we anticipated, but we persevered. We won multiple awards for the book, inlcuding one from <em>HOW Magazine.</em> My favorite part though is the white blocks on the cover which glow in the dark!</p>

          <h3>Screen Prints</h3>
          <p>Computers are excellent tools, but I find it refreshing to get my hands dirty. In college I was introduced to printmaking and it was a great reprieve from digital design. I love the experience of rolling ink, exposing screens, and seeing the satisfying, crisp print produced in the end (usually). I took enough classes, unbeknownst to me at the time, to earn a minor in printmaking.</p>

          <h3>Erie Art Museum Spring Show</h3>
          <p>For the Erie Art Museum's 88th Annual Spring Show I wanted to get away from the obvious crocuses and daffodils. Instead, I strove to illustrate the essence of Spring in form on the page. The blocks of light, weightless text lean from side to side giving the subtle feeling of wind, while the light paper texture and bold yellow headlines warm your eyes. The pages mimic a leisurely stroll along Lake Erie’s shore.</p>

          <h3>Bomb the Music Industry Book</h3>
          <p>Jeff Rosenstock is the former singer of punk-rock band, <em>Bomb the Music Industry.</em> Jeff's lyrics often get distorted by the fast-paced music and his intense, emotion-filled delivery. I crafted this “listener friendly” book to equip listeners with an easy-to-navigate guide to the lyrics flying by their ears. The book is color-coded by album, and page numbers correspond to the song's track number. The intensity of the page's color is linked to the tempo of each song. Duct tape binds the spine in true “punk” fashion.</p>

          <h3>Yeah, We're Designers, But...</h3>
          <p>Creating a split-gallery show with JP Spanbauer, one of my best friends, was a life-altering experience. Although we are both graphic designers, we each have our own span of different and exciting interests. The gallery show highlighted both our design work and our side projects. My half of the gallery featured a collage of photographs nailed to the walls bellow cotton clouds and pieces of “sky.” A recliner sitting next to a CD player featuring music I composed enabled the viewer to enter a world completely of my own creation. On the other side of the room, JP painted giant murals directly on the walls between framed screen prints. His handmade, screen printed pillows rested on a large heater in the room which most shows struggle to hide. Last, but not least, our design work was the centerpiece of the room, featured on podiums.</p>
